# PyTest


Did this for my self in free time

1. Create 2 DIFFERENT test cases for data checks on "AdventureWorks2012" database (3 different tables) and document them (name, steps, expected results).
Example TC#1 count for column; TC#2 average function for column, TC#3 max\min values, TC#4 values in range of list ...... etc.
Tables to use: 
-[Person].[Address]
-[Production].[Document]
-[Production].[UnitMeasure]
As a result you should have 6 diferent test cases for 3 different tables (2 per table).
2. Create a project for running Pytest tests.
3. Automate test cases from step 1 so that they can connect to MS SQL DB from SQL Module on your localhost.
4. Store a test report.
